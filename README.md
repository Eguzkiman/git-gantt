## What it does

GitGantt helps you visualize your team's milestones and issues on a gantt chart.

## Thats it?

Yup, that's pretty much by now. However, we plan to bring much more features in! Every feature we plan to add here: [URL]

## How to use it

Until the hosted version is available, you can use GitGantt by clonning the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/Eguzkiman/git-gantt`

installing dependencies:

`yarn`

and running the project with your GitHub's account personal token as an evironment variable:

`REACT_APP_TOKEN=<your-token-here> yarn start`

You can build & deploy GitGantt as any [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) application.

## Contributing

All PRs are welcome! You can find a list of issues to tackle here: [URL].

We want GitGantt to be a collective effort to make GitHub's data visualization better, so feel free to add any feature requests you like!
